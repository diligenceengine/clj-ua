# clj-ua

Clojure user-agent parser. Because I like pain.

Mostly based on the rules here: http://www.texsoft.it/index.php?m=sw.php.useragent

Note on update: After testing with a few strings from 

http://user-agents.my-addr.com/user_agent_request/user_agent_examples-and-user_agent_types.php

it seems that this code isn't very complete. Would suggest another library for now.

## Usage

to run the (large) amount of tests:
lein test


to parse a user-agent:
lein run -m clj-ua.core "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_4; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0 Safari/533.16"
